Power Analysis Tool using TCL
=============================
This project is trying to develop an open source power estimation tool. It mainly focuses on average switching power and leakage power. The analysis is based on Tool Command Language (TCL) code and takes SPICE netlist and fewer parameters as inputs and gives required power values along with modified netlist files.

# Power Tool Strategy
  Power estimation of a circuit is done using a simple formula power P = I X V. 
  - Average swithing power is calculated as product of average switching current and VDD i.e., Iavg xVDD.
  - Leakage ppower is calculated as product of leakage current and VDD i.e., Ileakage x VDD. 
 ######
 The main concept used for power calculation is creating a current controlled current source and taking average power which equals to 
 voltage step across the current source  during the time period. The voltage step is same for each time period. For clear information go through 
 [kang textbook pg 245-248](https://github.com/yalamanchilivahini5/VSD-opensource-TCL-power-tool/blob/master/Power%20Information/cmos%20digital%20circuits%20Kang.pdf)

# Inputs for TCL Power Tool
 The main input for power tool is spice netlist file. Some more inputs present in netlist are taken while executing code such as 
 - Supply voltage Node , Supply voltage name
 - For Average switching power, Minimum time period of circuit & Supply voltage value
 - For Leakage power calculation, No.of time varying inputs and their names.
# TCL Power Tool with examples
- First download or clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/yalamanchilivahini5/intern_poweranalysis_TCL.git`   
- To see circuit diagrams of *inverter* and *1-bit fast adder circuit*, Go to `Images`and see *inv_ckt.jpg* and *1bitadder_ckt.jpg*   
- Here are the steps for circuits simulation and run tcl codes to obtain power values.
- Make sure that netlist file, included files in netlist (if any) and power codes are present in same folder.

### CMOS Inverter
 1) Go to 'NGspice power folder' to run simulations (One can directly open terminal from Ngspice Power folder also). 
   ```
    $ cd Ngspice\ power/
   ```
 2) (optional step) Run desired circuit Netlist(for example *inverter*) to get output waveforms and then exit from ngspice shell.
   ```
   $ ngspice inv.cir
   ```
   **Inverter Transient analysis**    
    
   <img align="center" width="500"  src="/Images/inv_inout.JPG">
  
 3) To get average switching power and leakage power, run TCL code `power_modified.tcl` and enter required values.
   ```
   $ tclsh power_modified.tcl
   ```
 4) Enter required details and enter 1 for average switching power or 2 for leakage power. 
 5) If choice is average switching power enter required data and press enter.

 6) Additional file namely `switchingpower_netlist.cir` is added into the directory.
 7) If choice is leakage power, enter required data and press enter.

 8) A netlist file namely `leakagepower_netlist.cir` is added to directory.
 
 ### One-bit Fast Adder 
  Follow same steps to run any other simulation. Here is another circuit '1-bit fast adder'.
  
  1) Go to 'NGspice power folder' to run simulations (One can directly open terminal from Ngspice Power folder also). 
   ```
    $ cd Ngspice\ power/
   ```
 2) (optional step) Run desired circuit Netlist(here *1bit adder*) to get output waveforms and then exit from ngspice shell.
   ```
   $ ngspice 1bitadder.cir
   ```
   **1-bit fast adder Inputs A, B, Cin and Outputs S, Cout**    
    
   <img align="center" width="900" src="/Images/1bitadder_inout.JPG">
  
 3) To get average switching power and leakage power, run TCL code `power_modified.tcl` and enter required values.
   ```
   $ tclsh power_modified.tcl
   ```
 4) Enter required details and enter 1 for average switching power or 2 for leakage power.
 5) If choice is for average switching power, enter required data and press enter.

 ## TCL Power Tool Outputs Interpretation
  
  - Outputs power values dispalyed are in ***watt***.
  - Two files namely *switchingpower_netlist.cir* and *leakagepower_netlist.cir* are added after running whole power code.
    These are modified netlist files for calculating average switching power and leakage power respectively.
 
  To view waveforms for modified netlist, run these files (after running desired netlist) using ngspice by commenting quit statement.

   Voltage step for each 20ns is almost same and the value equals average switching power.

# Future Work
 The designed power tool only works for single supply voltage (VDD) circuits and it assumes there is atleast one switching activity in the given timeperiod.
 Also it is tested for osu018 technology. Hence it can be extended for multiple supply circuits and for various technologies.

# TCL Power Tool Usage

### Dependencies
 TCL Power Tool mainly works on NGSPICE and TCL shell. Here are steps for setup of required open source tools.
 - For installing ngspice 
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install ngspice

 ```
 $ sudo apt-get install tcl
